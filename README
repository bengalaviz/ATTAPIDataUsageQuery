UPDATE : This does not work anymore because of the 2 factor authentication requirement. :(

AT&T Consumer Data API Pull

This is a bash script that will log into your AT&T account and try to pull your
data usage.

Required Programs
Needs curl, jq, tee and bc for the script to work.

THIS IS NOT SUPPORTED BY AT&T. AT ANY TIME THIS SCRIPT COULD BREAK WHICH WILL
REQUIRED CHANGES TO FIX.

IT MAY NOT WORK FOR YOU. There is a field in the script called LOGIN_DATA. I
grabbed this from watching chrome inspector during the call to
'https://cprodmasx.att.com/commonLogin/igate_wam/multiLogin.do'. It may need to
be changed for a correct login to happen for you.

To install, you need to change the HOME variable to where this script is located
on your computer and update the PATH variable to where the required programs
are installed if not already on your PATH.

i.e.  HOME=/app/attdata
      PATH=/app/attdata/bin:${PATH}

This will make sure that when you schedule the script from crontab, it will work
correctly.
